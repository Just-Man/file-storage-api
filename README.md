# Task description

Create a V3S3 (Very Very Very Simple Storage System) . It should be implemented as a
(REST) API similar to Amazonâ€™s S3, but with far less functionality.
The API should be able to:
- Store an object (image, json data or anything else) with a specified name, through a
PUT request
- Return the same object when requested by the same name, through a GET request
- Delete an object by name, through a DELETE request. Objects should never actually
be deleted, but the object should not be returned in subsequent GET requests.
- Versioning history is required. If an object exists (even if it is marked as deleted) and
a new one is later stored with the same name, GET requests should receive the new
object but the old one should still be kept in storage and associated with that name.
- Object names should have the same constraints and requirements as in S3
The REST protocol details, like endpoints, states, headers, etc., are up to you. 

##### Requirements
###### Design
> 1. You can do it exactly like S3 
> 2. Completely different, but you have to provide at least basic documentation on how to use the API.

###### The server implementation should be in either
> 1. PHP 
> 2. NodeJS. 
###### Database
> - use any kind of database or none at all and store the objects however you like.

##### It is important to provide written instructions on how to setup and run the project.

# Develpment

4. Add new host name `<project-hostname.extesnion>`
5. Add new vhost for host name`<project-hostname.conf>`
6. Restart web server

8. setup your .env file 
> - for example see .env.example in project root directory
9. from project root you must execute
